1) Server user, installation not from root, running not from root (what's the best we can do?)
2) More optimal data/conf location
3) Server should shut down if it could not configure itself to listen on ports, load config, etc.
It should also output the problem.
4) Installation scripts mess with bash history
5) Input validation for installation scripts; also make them more adequate (no personal folders in code)
6) Code documentation
7) Better organization of repository files.
